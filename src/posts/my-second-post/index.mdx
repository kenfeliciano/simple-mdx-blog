excerpt: Here's some example text
---

Here's some example text hoping to get some suggestions. Nothing? Okay, let's try something else. How about something wimpy? Well, it doesn't like the word spelled R-E-A-L-L-Y as a whole sentence or a word apparently. I tried to use it as an example, in quotation marks, but it still flagged it. But also, it does not understand that I am using the word as an example. It's even in quotation marks! Its even in quotation marks! It doesn't catch crazy grammar errors. Spelling errors? How am I supposed to write good if this doesn't help me?

It took the ability to flag incorrect writing for me in certain situations.

Checking for lexical illusions is is fun.

There is something to be said for this. There are things to consider here. It must be a weasel word.

Need a spell checker for markdown. I hadn't turned on Code Spell Checker.

Ah, and write-good does look at mdx files now that I've configured it.
